## Airflow sensors
- A sensor is a type of operator that waits for a certain condition to be true before proceeding with downstream tasks in the DAG. 
- Sensors are useful when you need to wait for an external event or condition to occur before continuing with your workflow. 
- It can define how often to check for the condition to be true.
- Sensors are assigned to the tasks.
- For example, you might use a sensor to wait for a file to be created, a database table to be populated, or an API endpoint to become available.

## Sensor arguments
- Here are some common arguments that can be used with sensors in Airflow:
### mode
- Defines the mode in which the sensor should operate. 
- This can be either ```reschedule``` or ```poke```.
- Default is poke. When set to poke the sensor is taking up a worker slot for its whole execution time and sleeps between pokes. Use this mode if the expected runtime of the sensor is short or if a short poke interval is required.
- When set to ```reschedule``` the sensor task frees the worker slot when the criteria is not yet met and it's rescheduled at a later time.

### timeout
- The amount of time (in seconds) that the sensor should wait for the condition to be true before failing.

### poke_interval
- Time in seconds that the job should wait in between each try

## FileSensor
- The FileSensor is a sensor operator that waits for a file to exist on the local file system before continuing with downstream tasks in the DAG.
- Is part of the ```airflow.contrib.sensors``` library
```python
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from airflow.contrib.sensors import FileSensor

dag = DAG(
    dag_id='file_sensor_example',
    start_date=datetime(2022, 1, 1),
    catchup=False
)

wait_for_file = FileSensor(
    task_id='wait_for_file',
    filepath='/path/to/my/file.txt',
    poke_interval=30,
    dag=dag
)

process_file = BashOperator(
    task_id='process_file',
    bash_command='my_processing_script.sh',
    dag=dag
)

wait_for_file >> process_file
```
- In this example, the FileSensor named wait_for_file waits for a file located at /path/to/my/file.txt to be created. 
- The poke_interval parameter is set to 30 seconds, which means that the sensor will check for the file every 30 seconds. 
- Once the file exists, the sensor will finish and the downstream process_file task will be executed.

## Other types of sensors
- ***External Task Sensor*** - Waits for a task in a different DAG to complete.
- ***TimeDeltaSensor*** -W aits for a certain amount of time to pass.
- ***HttpSensor*** - Waits for an HTTP endpoint to return a successful response.
- ***SqlSensor*** - Runs a SQL query to check for content.
