## Sequential Executor
- The Sequential executor is the default executor in Airflow, which executes tasks sequentially in a single process. 
- This executor runs each task in a single process, which means that tasks are executed one after another and there is no parallelism involved. 
- This executor runs within the scheduler itself. (Executor & Scheduler will share the same machine)
- This executor executes each task one after another based on their dependencies defined in the DAG.
- The Sequential executor is suitable for development and testing purposes, where there is a need to execute small DAGs without requiring much scalability.
- SQLite is the default metadata database.

## Pros
- Easy to set up and configure.
- Suitable for small DAGs with simple dependencies.
- No additional resources are required.

## Cons
- Not suitable for large DAGs with complex dependencies.
- No parallelism involved, so it can be slow for large workflows.

# Local Executor
The Local executor is another executor available in Airflow, which runs tasks in parallel on a single machine. This executor is suitable for small to medium-sized DAGs, where there is a need for parallelism but not necessarily a distributed system. The Local executor can execute tasks in parallel on a single machine, which makes it faster than the Sequential executor.
Architecture:
The Local executor runs tasks in parallel on a single machine using multiprocessing. Each task is executed in a separate process, and the results are combined to produce the final output.

Pros:

Faster than the Sequential executor.
Suitable for small to medium-sized DAGs with parallelism.
Easy to set up and configure.
Cons:

Not suitable for large-scale distributed workflows.
Requires additional resources to execute tasks in parallel.
Celery Executor:
The Celery executor is a distributed executor that executes tasks using Celery, an open-source distributed task queue. This executor is suitable for large-scale workflows that require parallelism across multiple machines. The Celery executor can scale horizontally by adding more workers, making it suitable for handling large-scale workflows.
Architecture:
The Celery executor uses a distributed architecture, where each task is executed by a worker process on a separate machine. The Celery executor consists of three components, namely the Celery worker, the Celery broker, and the Celery result backend.

Pros:

Suitable for large-scale distributed workflows.
Provides parallelism across multiple machines.
Can scale horizontally by adding more workers.
Cons:

More complex to set up and configure than the Sequential and Local executors.
Requires additional resources to set up the Celery broker and result backend.
Kubernetes Executor:
The Kubernetes executor is a relatively new executor in Airflow, which executes tasks on a Kubernetes cluster. This executor is suitable for large-scale workflows that require dynamic scaling and fault tolerance. The Kubernetes executor can scale dynamically by creating and destroying Kubernetes pods, making it highly scalable.
Architecture:
The Kubernetes executor runs tasks as Kubernetes pods, which are orchestrated by the Kubernetes cluster. Each task is executed in a separate pod, and the results are combined to produce the final output.

Pros:

Highly scalable and fault-tolerant.
Suitable for large-scale workflows.
Provides dynamic scaling by creating and destroying Kubernetes pods.
Cons:

More complex to set up and configure than the Sequential, Local, and Celery executors.
Requires a Kubernetes cluster to run tasks, which can be costly to set up and maintain.
