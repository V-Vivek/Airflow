## Sequential Executor
- The Sequential executor is the default executor in Airflow, which executes tasks sequentially in a single process. 
- This executor runs each task in a single process, which means that tasks are executed one after another and there is no parallelism involved. 
- This executor runs within the scheduler itself. (Executor & Scheduler will share the same machine)
- This executor executes each task one after another based on their dependencies defined in the DAG.
- The Sequential executor is suitable for development and testing purposes, where there is a need to execute small DAGs without requiring much scalability.
- SQLite is the default metadata database.

## Pros
- ***No Setup Required***: comes as default executor preconfigured with airflow
- ***Light Weight***: no extra nodes required, all tasks run on scheduler node
- ***Cheap***: due to its light weight

## Cons
- ***Slow***: runs one task at a time
- ***Not Scalable***: because tasks run on same node where scheduler is running
- ***Single point of failure***: Tasks fail if scheduler node dies
- ***Not Suitable for production***: Because of all above

# Local Executor
- The Local executor is another executor available in Airflow, which runs tasks in parallel on a ***single machine***. 
- This executor is suitable for small to medium-sized DAGs, where there is a need for parallelism but not necessarily a distributed system. 
- The Local executor can execute tasks in parallel on a single machine, which makes it faster than the Sequential executor.

## Pros
- ***Easy to Setup***: simply set environment variable AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=LocalExecutor
- ***Cheap & Light Weight***: Task instances run on same machine where scheduler is running, so no extra resources required
- ***Faster than the Sequential executor***: Can run multiple tasks at a time

## Cons
- ***Single point of failure***: Tasks fail if scheduler node dies
- ***Not suitable to scale***: limited to scheduler node resources
- ***Not suitable for production***: because of all above

# Celery Executor
- The Celery executor is a distributed executor that executes tasks using Celery, an open-source distributed task queue. 
- The Celery executor consists of three components, namely the Celery worker, the Celery broker, and the Celery result backend.
- The Celery executor uses a distributed architecture, where each task is executed by a worker process on a separate machine. 
- This executor is suitable for large-scale workflows that require parallelism across multiple machines. 
- The Celery executor can scale horizontally by adding more workers, making it suitable for handling large-scale workflows.

## Pros
- ***Horizontally scalable***: Set as many number of workers as required
- ***Fault tolerant***: If a worker goes down, celery executor automatically assigns a task(s) to another healthy worker
- ***Production ready***: due to all above

## Cons
- ***Relatively Complex setup***: Additional resource setup required RabbbitMQ broker and workers
- ***Resource wastage if no task scheduled***: Celery workers always running even if the task queue is empty
- ***Not cost effective***: its pricier because of additional resources plus due to resource wastage.

# Kubernetes Executor
- The Kubernetes executor executes tasks on a Kubernetes cluster. 
- This executor is suitable for large-scale workflows that require dynamic scaling and fault tolerance. 
- The Kubernetes executor can scale dynamically by creating and destroying Kubernetes pods, making it highly scalable.
- Each task is executed in a separate pod and the results are combined to produce the final output.

## Pros
- ***Can Scale down to zero***:  If no task(s) is scheduled, no worker pod will spin-up, whereas it can scale up to as many pods as required. So no resource wastage.
- ***Fault tolerant***: Pods are re-spawned upon non-success termination
- ***Flexible resource allocation***: Each task can individually be assigned its memory allocation, airflow image as well as service account.
- ***Cost & resource effective***: Wonâ€™t be charged extra if no tasks(s) is scheduled

## Cons
- ***Pod launch time***: A new worker pod spins-up upon new tasks execution. This adds few seconds of latency in workflow.
- ***Complex setup***: Requires kubernetes knowledge, setting up cluster and executor configurations on top
