# What is Airflow?
- Airflow is an open-source platform designed for creating, scheduling and monitoring workflows. 
- It enables data engineers and scientists to create, schedule and manage complex data pipelines.

# Why Airflow?
- Airflow simplifies the creation of data pipelines and makes it easier to manage them. 
- It provides a scalable solution for scheduling and executing workflows, enabling users to process large amounts of data more efficiently. 
-Airflow also provides a rich set of features, such as monitoring, alerting and tracking, to help users manage their workflows effectively.

# Before Airflow era
- Before Airflow, users had to rely on a combination of tools such as cron jobs, custom scripts and other scheduling tools to schedule and manage data workflows. 
- These solutions lacked the flexibility and scalability required to handle complex workflows.

# After Airflow era
- After the introduction of Airflow, users now have a more robust, scalable and flexible solution for managing their data pipelines. 
- With Airflow, users can create complex workflows using a simple and intuitive interface, schedule them and monitor their progress in real-time.

# Core components of Airflow

## DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- DAG is a collection of tasks that are organized in a way that defines their dependencies. 
- The DAG defines the workflow and the order in which tasks should be executed.

## Task
- A unit of work that is executed within a DAG.
- Each task is associated with an operator, which defines the action to be performed. 
- A task can depend on other tasks to be completed before it can start.

## Operator
- Defines the action to be performed by a task.

## Scheduler
- Schedules and executes tasks according to the DAG's dependencies.

## Webserver
- Provides a web interface for monitoring and managing workflows.

## Database
- Stores metadata related to the workflows.

## Job
- A job is an instance of a task being executed. 
- When a task is scheduled to run, a job is created for it, which contains information about the task's execution, such as start time, end time and status.

# Advantages
- Airflow provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating, scheduling and managing workflows.
- Airflow's modular architecture enables users to extend and customize it to meet their specific needs.
- Airflow provides a scalable and flexible solution for managing complex data pipelines.
- Airflow provides a rich set of features for monitoring, alerting and tracking workflows.

# Disadvantages
- Airflow can be complex to set up and configure, especially for users who are not familiar with the platform.
- Airflow's web interface can be slow and sluggish when working with large workflows.
- Airflow requires a significant amount of resources to run, which can be costly for users who need to process large amounts of data.
