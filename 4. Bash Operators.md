## Bash Operators in Airflow

- In Airflow, Bash Operators are used to execute shell commands or scripts in a task. 
- These operators can be used for a wide range of tasks, including data processing, file manipulation, and system administration.

## How to use
- To use Bash Operators in Airflow, you need to import the BashOperator from the `airflow.operators.bash` module. 
- Here's an example of how to use the BashOperator to execute a simple shell command:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Define the DAG
dag = DAG(
    'my_bash_dag',
    description='A simple DAG to demonstrate the BashOperator',
    schedule_interval=None,
    start_date=datetime(2023, 4, 16),
    catchup=False
)

# Define the BashOperator
my_bash_task = BashOperator(
    task_id='my_bash_task',
    bash_command='echo "Hello, World!"',
    dag=dag
)
