# Apache Airflow Architecture Components:

## Web Server
- This is the UI of Airflow, that can be used to get an overview of the overall health of different Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) and also help in visualizing different components and states of each DAG. 
- The Web Server also provides the ability to manage users, roles, and different configurations for the Airflow setup.

## Scheduler
- This is the most important part of Airflow, which orchestrates various DAGs and their tasks, taking care of their interdependencies, limiting the number of runs of each DAG so that one DAG doesn’t overwhelm the entire system, and making it easy for users to schedule and run DAGs on Airflow.

## Executor
- While the Scheduler orchestrates the tasks, the executors are the components that actually execute tasks. 
- There are various types of executors that come with Airflow, such as SequentialExecutor, LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, and the KubernetesExecutor. 
- People usually select the executor that suits their use case best.

## Metadata Database
- Airflow supports a variety of databases for its metadata store.
- This database stores metadata about DAGs, their runs, and other Airflow configurations like users, roles, and connections. 
- The Web Server shows the DAG’s states and their runs from the database. The Scheduler also updates this information in this metadata database.
